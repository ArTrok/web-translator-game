# web-translator-game
A simple game about translating words and getting a score/result

Since this is just to help a friend and supposed to be easy to use, I will be using TypeScript with React.
I will probably create automated tests but not TDD.

### What to expect from this application?
The main reason for this app is to practice any language of your choice(only english to portuguese at the moment).
There will be a number of rounds
You will get a random word for each round
Guess the translation for the word and score points
After you finish the rounds, you get your final score and the answers for each word
